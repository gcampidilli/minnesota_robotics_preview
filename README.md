# minnesota_robotics_preview
A portion of the scripts I have developed for my work with the Minnesota Robotics Institute and Interactive Robotics and Computer Vision Lab. My project focuses on enabling robots to identify invasive species.

Image data not included in this repo. 

Images were annotated with Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT), and exported with YOLO format.
